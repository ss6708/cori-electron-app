# Bloomberg Integration Analysis for Cori

## Executive Summary

This document analyzes the approach for integrating Bloomberg data into Cori to enable users to pull financial data directly into spreadsheets. The integration assumes users have access to a Bloomberg Terminal with the appropriate licenses and add-ins installed.

## Current Architecture Analysis

Cori's architecture consists of:
- A Flask backend (`backend/server.py`) that uses `win32com.client` for Excel COM automation
- A React/TypeScript frontend with an Excel agent UI component (`src/excel-agent-ui.tsx`)
- An Electron wrapper that launches both the frontend and backend

The existing Excel COM automation provides a foundation for Bloomberg integration, as it already interacts with Excel spreadsheets programmatically.

## Bloomberg API Options Analysis

Bloomberg offers several API options for accessing financial data:

### 1. Bloomberg Desktop API (Excel Add-in)

**Key Features:**
- Provides Excel formulas like `=BDP()`, `=BDH()`, and `=BQL()` for data retrieval
- Installed as an Excel add-in on machines with Bloomberg Terminal access
- Supports real-time and historical data retrieval
- Requires Bloomberg Terminal license and installation

**Integration Complexity:** Medium
- Leverages existing Excel COM automation
- Requires detecting and interacting with Bloomberg Excel add-in

### 2. Bloomberg API (BLPAPI)

**Key Features:**
- Native SDK available for multiple languages including Python, Java, and C++
- Provides programmatic access to Bloomberg data
- Supports request/response and subscription-based data retrieval
- Requires Bloomberg Terminal or B-PIPE enterprise subscription

**Integration Complexity:** High
- Requires installation of Bloomberg API SDK
- Needs Bloomberg Terminal running for authentication
- More complex implementation but offers greater flexibility

### 3. Bloomberg Query Language (BQL)

**Key Features:**
- Modern API for accessing normalized, curated Bloomberg data
- Allows custom calculations in the Bloomberg cloud
- Available through Bloomberg Terminal's BQNT (Bloomberg Quant) environment
- Python libraries available for programmatic access

**Integration Complexity:** High
- Requires BQNT environment setup
- Needs specialized knowledge of BQL syntax
- Most powerful for complex financial calculations

### 4. B-PIPE (Bloomberg Private IP Environment)

**Key Features:**
- Enterprise-level data feed for large organizations
- Provides consolidated market data feed
- Supports high-volume data access
- Requires separate enterprise subscription

**Integration Complexity:** Very High
- Enterprise-level implementation
- Requires dedicated infrastructure
- Not suitable for individual user integration

## Recommended Integration Approach

Based on the analysis of available options and Cori's architecture, we recommend a **multi-tiered approach** that prioritizes the Bloomberg Desktop API (Excel Add-in) integration while providing a path to more advanced integration options.

### 1. Primary Integration: Bloomberg Desktop API via Excel COM Automation

**Recommendation: Create a dedicated Bloomberg service in the backend**

```
backend/
  ├── server.py (existing)
  ├── services/
  │   ├── __init__.py
  │   ├── bloomberg_service.py (new)
  │   └── excel_service.py (new, refactored from server.py)
  └── requirements.txt (update with Bloomberg dependencies)
```

The `bloomberg_service.py` would:
- Detect if the Bloomberg Excel add-in is installed and active
- Generate Bloomberg Excel formulas programmatically
- Insert formulas into Excel cells via COM automation
- Refresh data and read results
- Handle error states and authentication issues

### 2. Excel Integration Layer

The Excel integration would:
- Use COM automation to write Bloomberg formulas to cells
- Support common Bloomberg formula types:
  - `=BDP("ticker", "field")` for point data
  - `=BDH("ticker", "field", "start_date", "end_date")` for historical data
  - `=BQL("query")` for Bloomberg Query Language
- Trigger formula refreshes via COM commands
- Read formula results back from cells

### 3. API Endpoints

**Recommendation: Add new Flask endpoints to server.py**

```python
@app.route('/bloomberg/check', methods=['GET'])
def check_bloomberg():
    # Check if Bloomberg add-in is available

@app.route('/bloomberg/data', methods=['POST'])
def get_bloomberg_data():
    # Generate and insert Bloomberg formula into Excel

@app.route('/bloomberg/refresh', methods=['POST'])
def refresh_bloomberg_data():
    # Refresh Bloomberg data in the current worksheet
```

### 4. Frontend Integration

**Recommendation: Add Bloomberg-specific UI components without modifying Excel code**

Since Excel-related functionality is being developed separately, the Bloomberg integration UI should be implemented as a standalone component that communicates with the backend services but doesn't modify the Excel embedding code.

### 5. Advanced Integration Option: Direct BLPAPI Integration

For more advanced use cases, a secondary integration path using the Bloomberg Python API (BLPAPI) could be implemented:

```python
def get_bloomberg_data_direct(securities, fields, options=None):
    """
    Get data directly from Bloomberg API without using Excel
    """
    import blpapi  # Bloomberg Python API
    
    session = blpapi.Session()
    session.start()
    session.openService("//blp/refdata")
    refDataService = session.getService("//blp/refdata")
    
    request = refDataService.createRequest("ReferenceDataRequest")
    
    # Add securities and fields to request
    for security in securities:
        request.append("securities", security)
    
    for field in fields:
        request.append("fields", field)
    
    # Send request and process response
    session.sendRequest(request)
    # Process and return response data
    
    return data_frame  # Return data as pandas DataFrame
```

## Technical Implementation Considerations

### 1. Bloomberg Formula Generation

The Bloomberg service would need to:
- Generate appropriate Bloomberg formulas based on user requests
- Support different data types (real-time, historical, reference)
- Handle Bloomberg-specific syntax and options
- Support common financial data points (e.g., price, volume, fundamentals)

### 2. Authentication and Access Requirements

Bloomberg integration requires:
- A valid Bloomberg Terminal license
- Bloomberg Terminal software installed on the user's machine
- Bloomberg Excel add-in installed and configured
- Appropriate permissions for the requested data

### 3. Excel COM Automation for Bloomberg

For interacting with the Bloomberg Excel add-in:
```python
def insert_bloomberg_formula(cell_reference, formula):
    excel = win32com.client.Dispatch("Excel.Application")
    worksheet = excel.ActiveSheet
    cell = worksheet.Range(cell_reference)
    cell.Formula = formula
    
    # Force calculation to refresh Bloomberg data
    excel.Calculate()
    
    # Wait for data to load
    time.sleep(2)
    
    # Read result
    result = cell.Value
    
    return {"status": "success", "cell": cell_reference, "formula": formula, "result": result}
```

### 4. Error Handling

Robust error handling for:
- Bloomberg Terminal not running
- Bloomberg Excel add-in not installed
- Formula syntax errors
- Data retrieval timeouts
- Subscription or permission issues
