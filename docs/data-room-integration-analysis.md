# Data Room Integration Analysis for Cori

## Executive Summary

This document analyzes the approach for integrating data room providers like Intralinks into Cori to create a capability that can pull data room documents directly into the application. Data rooms are an essential part of the deal process, where documents are uploaded and accessed by bankers and clients. This integration will enhance Cori's financial modeling capabilities by providing direct access to critical transaction documents.

## Current Architecture Analysis

Cori's architecture consists of:
- A minimal Flask backend (`backend/server.py`) that uses `win32com.client` for Excel COM automation
- A React/TypeScript frontend with an Excel agent UI component (`src/excel-agent-ui.tsx`)
- An Electron wrapper that launches both the frontend and backend

The application specializes in financial transactions and deal structures including Leveraged Buyouts (LBOs), Corporate M&A, Debt Modeling, and Private Lending. The AI components of Cori are developed independently of the UI and Excel integration layers, allowing for separate development of the RAG system and knowledge base architecture.

## Data Room Provider Analysis

2. **Datasite (formerly Merrill DataSite)**
   - Specialized M&A data room provider with developer APIs
   - OAuth2 authentication for secure access
   - APIs for document retrieval and metadata access

3. **DealRoom**
   - REST API with predictable URL structure
   - Capabilities for creating rooms, managing users, and uploading documents
   - Token-based authentication through the "Profile Settings Panel"

6. **DocuSign Rooms**
   - Secure workspaces for transaction document collaboration
   - Comprehensive API documentation for programmatic access
   - Integration with DocuSign's electronic signature capabilities

## Data Room Integration Approach

### 1. Backend Service Layer

**Recommendation: Create a multi-provider data room service in the backend**

```
backend/
  ├── server.py (existing)
  ├── services/
  │   ├── __init__.py
  │   ├── data_room_service.py (new)
  │   └── provider/
  │       ├── __init__.py
  │       ├── intralinks_provider.py (new)
  │       ├── datasite_provider.py (new)
  │       ├── dealroom_provider.py (new)
  │       └── box_provider.py (new)
  └── requirements.txt (update with data room API dependencies)
```

The `data_room_service.py` would:
- Implement a provider-agnostic interface for data room operations
- Handle authentication with different data room providers
- Provide methods for document retrieval, search, and metadata access
- Cache authentication tokens and document metadata for performance

Each provider implementation would:
- Implement the common interface for its specific API
- Handle provider-specific authentication flows
- Translate between Cori's data models and the provider's API responses
- Manage rate limiting and error handling for the specific provider

### 2. Document Processing Layer

**Recommendation: Create a document processing service for extracted data room content**

```
backend/
  ├── services/
  │   ├── document_processing/
  │   │   ├── __init__.py
  │   │   ├── document_parser.py (new)
  │   │   ├── financial_extractor.py (new)
  │   │   └── document_indexer.py (new)
```

The document processing service would:
- Extract text and structured data from various document formats (PDF, Excel, Word)
- Identify financial data points relevant to transaction modeling
- Create searchable indexes of document content
- Prepare document content for integration with Cori's RAG system

### 3. API Endpoints

**Recommendation: Add new Flask endpoints to server.py**

```python
@app.route('/data-room/authenticate', methods=['POST'])
def authenticate_data_room():
    # Handle data room provider authentication

@app.route('/data-room/providers', methods=['GET'])
def list_data_room_providers():
    # List available data room providers

@app.route('/data-room/documents', methods=['GET'])
def list_data_room_documents():
    # List documents from the data room

@app.route('/data-room/document/<document_id>', methods=['GET'])
def get_data_room_document():
    # Retrieve a specific document from the data room

@app.route('/data-room/search', methods=['POST'])
def search_data_room():
    # Search for documents in the data room
```

### 4. Frontend Integration

**Recommendation: Add data room-specific UI components without modifying Excel code**

Since Excel-related functionality is being developed separately, the data room integration UI should be implemented as a standalone component that communicates with the backend services but doesn't modify the Excel embedding code.

```
src/
  ├── components/
  │   ├── data-room/
  │   │   ├── DataRoomProvider.tsx (new)
  │   │   ├── DocumentList.tsx (new)
  │   │   ├── DocumentViewer.tsx (new)
  │   │   └── SearchInterface.tsx (new)
```

The frontend components would:
- Allow users to connect to their data room provider
- Browse and search for documents in the data room
- View document content and metadata
- Select documents for analysis in Cori

### 5. AI Integration Layer

**Recommendation: Extend Cori's RAG system to incorporate data room documents**

```
backend/
  ├── services/
  │   ├── ai/
  │   │   ├── __init__.py
  │   │   ├── document_embedder.py (new)
  │   │   ├── financial_rag.py (new)
  │   │   └── data_extraction.py (new)
```

The AI integration would:
- Create embeddings for data room documents
- Extend the RAG system to incorporate document content
- Extract financial data points from documents for use in modeling
- Generate insights from document content relevant to the transaction

## Technical Implementation Considerations

### 1. Authentication and Security

Data room providers require secure authentication:
- Implement OAuth2 flows for each provider
- Securely store access tokens
- Handle token refresh and expiration
- Respect data room security policies and access controls

### 2. Document Access and Processing

Document retrieval and processing considerations:
- Handle large document sizes efficiently
- Support various document formats (PDF, Excel, Word, PowerPoint)
- Extract text and structured data from documents
- Maintain document version history

### 3. Performance Optimization

Performance considerations for data room integration:
- Implement caching for document metadata and content
- Use background processing for document indexing
- Optimize network requests to data room APIs
- Implement pagination for large document collections

### 4. Error Handling

Robust error handling for:
- Authentication failures
- API rate limiting
- Document access permissions
- Network connectivity issues
- Document format incompatibilities

8. Test with real transaction documents

## Conclusion

Integrating data room providers into Cori will significantly enhance its capabilities for financial transaction modeling by providing direct access to critical deal documents. The proposed multi-provider approach allows for flexibility in supporting different data room providers while maintaining a consistent interface for Cori's users.

By leveraging the APIs of data room providers like Intralinks, Datasite, DealRoom, and Box, Cori can access documents directly from the data rooms where they are stored, extract relevant financial information, and incorporate this data into its financial models. This integration respects the constraint that Excel-related functionality is being developed separately by creating a standalone service that interacts with the data room providers without modifying the Excel embedding code.

The integration with Cori's RAG system will further enhance the value of the data room documents by enabling AI-powered analysis and insights, making Cori an even more powerful tool for financial transaction modeling.
